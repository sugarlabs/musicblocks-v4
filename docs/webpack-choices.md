# Various Architectural Choices and the thought processes behind them

## Production Build Optimizations

- Setup webpack bundle analyzer - the largest bundles are
  - `p5` (extensively used)
  - `esprima` (which is a peerdep of `js-yaml`, only used in one place).
- Also had a look at bundle compression methods - `gzip` and `brotli`
  - the drawbacks are these need to be enabled at a web server level
  - support varies in static files hosts. Will be using compression-webpack-plugin for this.
- `p5` - production build lib - `p5.min.js` - 800KB -> compressed to 197KB
- GitHub pages supports `gzip` but doesnt support `brotli`
- Did not consider mangling output code (uglify.js and the likes)
- Used `webpack-compression-plugin` with gzip and a threshold of 50KB to compress files

## Compression Algorithm Choice: `gzip` vs `brotli`

### gzip

- generic file compression format
- can be used to compress build files for serving a site
- decent compression ratio
- fast compression/decompression
- needs to be enabled at web server level

### brotli

- generic lossless compression algorithm built specifically for web pages
- larger compression ratio than gzip
- faster compression/decompression than gzip
- lesser support from static site hosts (GitHub pages doesnâ€™t support brotli yet)

## Final Choice: `gzip`

### Reasons

- supported by GitHub pages
- older and more supported by a large variety of systems
