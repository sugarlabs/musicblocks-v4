## Introduction

Musicblocks-v4: Visual Programming Language & tools for musical/mathematical exploration in a fun way.

## System Overview

### Tech Stack

- **Client-side Web Application**:
  - **Written in TypeScript**: *TypeScript: JavaScript superset, adds static typing.*
  - **UI Components with React**: *React: efficient JavaScript library for UI.*
  - **Flexibility in UI**: Works with any JS library, framework, or DOM API.*

### Bundling and Tooling

- **Vite**: *Vite, the project bundler, speeds up development using native ES module imports.*
- **SCSS**: *SCSS (Sass) styles for a structured CSS approach.*

#### Development Environment

- **Node.js**: *The project needs Node.js for server-side JavaScript execution.*

### Tooling

- **ESLint**: *ESLint enforces code quality, ensuring consistent, high-quality standards.*
- **Docker**: *Docker: Ensures consistent, isolated environments for dev and deployment via containerization.*

#### Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Jest**: *Jest tests JavaScript, ensuring unit test coverage for code.*
- **Cypress**: *Cypress simulates user behavior for end-to-end testing, ensuring application functionality.*

#### Contributing and Development Process

- **GitHub Project Management**:
  - The project leverages GitHub for task management via its Projects tab.
  - Discussions tab is used for planning and tracking progress.

- **Parallel Development Repository**:
  - Development of the programming framework occurs in the musicblocks-v4-lib repository.
  - The 'develop' branch and related feature branches serve as sources for updates.
  - Issues tab in both repositories is used to track tasks and issues.
